From Figure(1), we can see that in 2019 the United States of America has the highest population of 328239523 among the countries of North America, then Mexico that has a population of 127575529 then Canada that has population of 37593384.</p>

<p>from Figure(2) we can see that the elderly population among the North America countries follows the same ranking of the total population we did in question 1 , so that in 2019 the United States of America has the highest elderly population of 53206334, then Mexico that has elderly population of 9461844 then Canada that has elderly population of 6634442.</p>
<p>Also from Figure (2), we can see the portion of the elderly population among the whole population in each country.</p>

<p>To answer this question we will use the indicator of fertility rate that is defined as the total births per woman in the country as we can see in Figure(3), using the fertility rate as an indicator to the birth rate, we can see that Haiti has the highest fertility rate in 2019 among the North America countries of value 2.89. Also we can see that the fertility rate in Canada was 1.47 in 2019.</p>

<p>To answer this question we will use the indicator of Death Rate Crude Per 1000 People in the country, as we can see in Figure(4), using the Death Rate Crude Per 1000 People as an indicator to the mortality rate, we can see that Grenada has the highest mortality rate in 2019 among the North America countries of value 9.58. Also we can see that in 2019 the death rate in Canada was 7.60 and the lowest death rate was in Honduras of value 4.45.</p>

<h2>Question 5: How does the population in Canada change over time?</h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From Figure (5) shown above , we can see that the population in Canada increases every year so that starting from year 1960 the population was 17909009 and it keeps increasing linearly reaching to population of 30685730 in 2000 and population of 37593384 in 2019.</p>

<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" />
From Figure (6) shown above , we can see that the age distribution in Canada in 1960 that the zero to 9 age group was contributed more in the population than in 2019 and also in 2019 the plus eighty age group has a larger contribution in the population compared to 1960 where the contribution is almost zero and from 1960 to 2019 the contribution of the two age groups forty to forty nine and fifty to fifty nine increases over time.</p>

<div id="section-question-7-is-the-modern-technology-that-is-present-in-all-life-aspects-including-healthcare-affect-the-human-lifespan-in-canada" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 7: Is the modern technology that is present in all life aspects including healthcare affect the human lifespan in Canada?</h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>from Figure(7), we can see that the modern technology present in all life aspects including healthcare affect the human lifespan in Canada, so that human tends to live longer as the population of the age group of eighty and above increases with time and technology.</p>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can have a closer look by plotting the population of group age 80 and above from 1960 to 2019, as we can see in Figure (8) that there is an increase of this age group in Canada’s population since 1960 and since 2000 this increase became a little higher.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-question-8-is-the-modern-lifestyle-in-canada-affect-the-adolescent-mind-regarding-giving-birth-in-this-phase-of-their-life" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 8: Is the modern lifestyle in Canada affect the adolescent mind regarding giving birth in this phase of their life?</h2>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>From Figure (9), we can see that the Adolescent fertility rate in Canada has tremendously decreases over time starting at 1960 the adolescent fertility rate was 55.63 reaching to adolescent fertility rate of 7.68 in 2019. it seems that the modern life style in Canada has the effect to decrease the adolescent women fertility rate.</p>
