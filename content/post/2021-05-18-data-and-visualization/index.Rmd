## Data visualization Exercise
```{r}
library(dplyr)
starwars 
```
### Mass Vs Weight 
We will study the mass vs weight relationship through a scatter plot
```{r warning=False}
library (ggplot2)
ggplot(starwars,aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "                               Mass vs. height of Starwars characters",
       x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)")
  
```
